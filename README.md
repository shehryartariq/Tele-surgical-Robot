# Tele-surgical-Robot
This Project is the first ever prototype of Tele-Surgical Robot developed at SEECS NUST. Tele-Surgical Robotics is a new concept and a lot of research is being done around the world in this field.
Main domains of Tele-surgical robotics in which work can be done are: 
Embedded Systems
Control Systems
Network Communications 
Programming 
Tele-Surgery can be used to operate patients who are present in remote area. A robotic arm is fixed at patient site. Surgeon can control that robot sitting in his room with the help of joystick. Surgeon can also see the views of Patient side with the help of camera. Control Signals are sent to Patient PC via internet connection. Micro-controllers connected to patient PC control the movement of the Robot.
Peg Transfer Exercise is the basic exercise for the training of surgeons. This exercise was performed with the developed system. Initially there were few hindrances in the peg transfer exercise. It was not easy at all to perform but with certain improvements, peg transfer exercise was successfully executed.
